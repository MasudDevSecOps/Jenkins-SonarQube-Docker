Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with SonarQube, Docker, GitHub Webhooks on AWS
This project aims to set up a robust and efficient Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins, SonarQube, 
Docker, and GitHub Webhooks on the AWS platform. The pipeline enables automated building, testing, and deployment of code changes to production, 
ensuring high-quality code and rapid application delivery.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

AWS account: You need an AWS account to provision and manage the required resources.
Docker: Install Docker on your local development machine to create and manage containerized applications.
Jenkins: Set up a Jenkins server to orchestrate the CI/CD pipeline.
SonarQube: Install and configure SonarQube for static code analysis and quality checks.
GitHub repository: Create a repository to store your code and set up webhooks for triggering the pipeline.
Setup Steps
Provision AWS resources:

Launch an EC2 instance for hosting the Jenkins server.
Set up security groups and configure necessary permissions.
Ensure the EC2 instance has access to the GitHub repository and SonarQube server.
Install and configure Jenkins:

Connect to the EC2 instance and install Jenkins following the official documentation.
Set up plugins such as Git, Docker, and SonarQube Scanner in Jenkins.
Configure Jenkins with necessary credentials for accessing GitHub and SonarQube.
Configure SonarQube:

Install SonarQube on a separate server or use a Docker container.
Set up a SonarQube project and generate an access token for Jenkins to use.
Create the Jenkins pipeline:

Define a Jenkinsfile that describes the pipeline stages.
Configure the pipeline to pull code from the GitHub repository.
Integrate SonarQube analysis to check code quality during the pipeline execution.
Build and package the application using Docker.
Configure GitHub webhooks:

In the GitHub repository settings, create a webhook that points to the Jenkins server.
Set up the webhook to trigger on specific events, such as push or pull request.
Test and deploy:

Make changes to the code and push them to the GitHub repository.
Observe Jenkins automatically triggering the pipeline via the webhook.
Jenkins should perform code quality checks, build Docker images, and deploy the application to the desired environment.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create an effective CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, and GitHub Webhooks on the AWS platform. 
This pipeline will enable you to automate the software development lifecycle, ensuring code quality, reducing manual efforts, and enabling faster 
and more reliable deployments.
